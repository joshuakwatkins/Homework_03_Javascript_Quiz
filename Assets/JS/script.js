// on start, begin a set interval for 75 seconds and advance the index a position to show which card

// sooo for every question (stored as a list within an object? or as an array?)
// if (event.target.hasAttribute.dataSet.correct)
// then advance to the next card, and display correct/incorect for an interval.
// also probably i want include a running score
// else we subtract 10 from the interval and display the next card.
// repeat for questions 2 through 5.
// upon selecting an answer for question 5, the timer stops
// and you are presented your final score and are prompted to enter your initials for your high score.
// your high score is then appended to an object containing 2 arrays,
// one for the initials input and one for the score, and stored in local storage
// the scoreboard is then procedurally generated using a for loop
// and some conditional css formatting (nth child?)
